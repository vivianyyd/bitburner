Algorithmic Stock Trader IV

You are given the following array with two elements:

[2, [167,45,169,81,113,93,18,10,38,78,81,60,164,150,4,39,146,73,156,75,192,83,79]]

The first element is an integer k. The second element is an array of stock prices (which are numbers) where the i-th
element represents the stock price on day i.

Determine the maximum possible profit you can earn using at most k transactions. A transaction is defined as buying
and then selling one share of the stock. Note that you cannot engage in multiple transactions at once. In other
words, you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

If no profit can be made, then the answer should be 0.

Sanitize Parentheses in Expression


Given the following string:

((()(()aa)a

remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to validate the string. If there are multiple minimal ways 
to validate the string, provide all of the possible results. The answer should be provided as an array of strings. If 
it is impossible to validate the string the result should be an array with only an empty string. 

IMPORTANT: The string may contain letters, not just parentheses. Examples:
"()())()" -> [()()(), (())()]
"(a)())()" -> [(a)()(), (a())()]
")( -> [""]
